## Importance of Biosphere Reserves

Biosphere reserves are critical for preserving **ecological integrity**. They serve three main purposes:

1. **Conservation**: Protect landscapes, ecosystems, species, and genetic resources.
2. **Development**: Promote economic development that is socio-culturally and ecologically sustainable.
3. **Logistical Support**: Facilitate research, education, and monitoring for environmental learning.

These reserves often act as **living laboratories**, balancing human livelihood needs with nature conservation.

## India and the UNESCO MAB Programme

The **Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme**, launched by UNESCO in 1971, aims to establish a scientific basis for improving relationships between people and their environment.

India joined this global initiative in 1986 and has since actively contributed to its goals. As of 2025, India is home to **12 internationally recognized biosphere reserves**, reflecting the country’s commitment to ecological sustainability.

## Conclusion

India's 18 biosphere reserves showcase the country’s rich environmental diversity and commitment to **conservation through sustainable development**. With over half of them included in the **UNESCO MAB Programme**, these regions stand as global models of balancing biodiversity protection and human livelihood.

By understanding and supporting these regions, we contribute to a future where **nature and people coexist harmoniously**.
