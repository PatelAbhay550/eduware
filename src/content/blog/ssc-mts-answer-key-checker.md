The wait is finally over (or almost over) for lakhs of aspirants. With the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) releasing the provisional response sheets, the race to figure out your raw score has begun.

But let's be honest: manually checking 90-100 questions, applying negative marking formulas ($ -0.25 $ or $ -1 $ depending on the section), and summing it up is a headache. It’s prone to human error and doesn't tell you where you actually stand in the competition.

If you are looking for the fastest way to **Calculate SSC MTS Answer Key** scores without the math struggle, we have built a dedicated tool just for you.

## Why Manual Calculation Fails
Most students make simple mistakes when calculating their scores manually:
1.  **ignoring Negative Marking:** It’s easy to miss subtracting marks for those 3-4 silly mistakes.
2.  **Sectional Confusion:** SSC MTS has different marking schemes for Session 1 (Qualifying) and Session 2 (Merit). Mixing these up gives you a wrong prediction.
3.  **No Normalization Idea:** Your raw score might be 110, but if your shift was hard, your normalized score could be 125+. Manual checking can't predict this.

## The Solution: Automatic Rank & Score Checker

We have developed a free, automated tool that does the heavy lifting for you. instead of counting options A, B, C, or D, you simply paste your response sheet URL, and our system parses the data instantly.
